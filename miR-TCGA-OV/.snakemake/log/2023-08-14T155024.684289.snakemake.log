Building DAG of jobs...
Relative file path './tcga_mir_LOGdata.RDS' starts with './'. This is redundant and strongly discouraged. It can also lead to inconsistent results of the file-matching approach used by Snakemake. You can simply omit the './' for relative file paths.
Using shell: /bin/bash
Provided cores: 1 (use --cores to define parallelism)
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.

MissingOutputException in rule download_coldata in file /home/ieva/rprojects/tcga-ov-model/miR-TCGA-OV/Snakefile, line 1:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
./tcga_mir_LOGdata.RDS
Shutting down, this might take some time.
